On the negative side, this has a plastic jack to insert, which breaks in about 6 months of regular use. (If you are handing it to youngsters it would probably break sooner.)

The company could think of coming up with more color options for easy differentiation.It is easy to use and carry, so that makes up on the durability.

On the negative side, this has a plastic jack to insert, which breaks in about 6 months of regular use. (If you are handing it to youngsters it would probably break sooner.) The second drawback is the color. As it is the same for everyone else, so losing it in office (college groups) is quite possible. The company could think of coming up with more color options for easy differentiation.It is easy to use and carry, so that makes up on the durability. The speed it gives is not lightning fast but it works for most Indian made laptops (or desktops).

On the negative side, this has a plastic jack to insert, which breaks in about 6 months of regular use. (If you are handing it to youngsters it would probably break sooner.)

The company could think of coming up with more color options for easy differentiation.It is easy to use and carry, so that makes up on the durability.

Made of good quality material.2. Fairly good read and write speed for USB 2.0.3. Easy to install.4. Convenient shape which makes its handling easy.Cons-1. Made up of plastic, not metal. So somewhat breakable.2. Reading speed not very fast as it is not USB 3.0 compatible.Final comment- Go for it if you want a cheap pen drive. If you want a high speed and durable pen drive then go for some other metal USB 3.0 or 3.1 pen drive.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 3 September 2018", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "22 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/SanDisk-Cruzer-Blade-Flash-Drive/product-reviews/B005FYNT3G?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

I have several of these, and mostly use them to transfer files between non-networked computers.Nothing huge, so the speed limitations of USB 2.0 aren't an issue- I can wait an extra 2 seconds for things to copy. The small size of the drive is both a positive and negative attribute; I have lost them before, but they're very easy to keep in every laptop bag I have, on a keychain, etc.Given the price, losing one or two has never been heartbreaking (any files on them also exist on multiple laptops and backups, so that's not really a concern).I've been using these for a few years now, and never had one fail. Scandisk has great quality, as usual, for our day to day photos of family, friends, and pets. I have never had a problem with any Scandisk product.So, folks, I would\u200b call this a win-win!

The company could think of coming up with more color options for easy differentiation.It is easy to use and carry, so that makes up on the durability.

The company could think of coming up with more color options for easy differentiation.It is easy to use and carry, so that makes up on the durability.

The small size of the drive is both a positive and negative attribute; I have lost them before, but they're very easy to keep in every laptop bag I have, on a keychain, etc.Given the price, losing one or two has never been heartbreaking (any files on them also exist on multiple laptops and backups, so that's not really a concern).I've been using these for a few years now, and never had one fail.
